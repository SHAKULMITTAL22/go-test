Below are various test scenarios for the `Mervin1` function, ensuring coverage of normal operations, edge cases, and understanding the function's behavior based on its logic.

### Scenario 1: Output when input is 1

Details:
  Description: This test checks that when the input is `1`, the function returns the string "x".
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required since the input is simply 1.
  Act: Invoke `Mervin1(1)`.
  Assert: Verify that the return value is "x".
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly recognizes the input `1` and returns "x", which corresponds to the first conditional branch in the implementation. This test is important to validate the function handles this common case as expected.

### Scenario 2: Output when input is 2

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that an input of `2` results in the function returning the string "y".
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required since the input is simply 2.
  Act: Invoke `Mervin1(2)`.
  Assert: Confirm that the return value is "y".
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the function handles input `2` correctly, which calls the second branch of conditional logic. It's crucial to verify correct results for known values in order to maintain expected application behavior.

### Scenario 3: Output when input is not 1 or 2

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function behaves with an input that is neither `1` nor `2`, expecting it to return "z".
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup necessary as it will use any integer other than 1 or 2.
  Act: Call `Mervin1(3)` (or any other number besides 1 or 2).
  Assert: Confirm that the result is "z".
Validation:
  The assertion tests the fallback mechanism of the function. Testing this is critical because it ensures that any unhandled input defaults to the function's defined behavior, which is to return "z".

### Scenario 4: Output with negative input

Details:
  Description: Verifies the function's behavior with a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required. Use `-1` or any negative value.
  Act: Execute `Mervin1(-1)`.
  Assert: Check that the output is "z".
Validation:
  Using a negative value tests how the function deals with an unexpected input outside the typical positive number range. The expectation of "z" ensures that the function maintains consistent behavior for out-of-bound inputs, reinforcing its robustness.

### Scenario 5: Output with zero as input

Details:
  Description: This test assesses what happens when the input is `0`, a boundary value within integers but not specified in the logic to return "x" or "y".
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a straightforward input of 0.
  Act: Test by calling `Mervin1(0)`.
  Assert: Confirm that it returns "z".
Validation:
  Zero is often used in testing as a boundary value. This test validates that if zero appears as input, it correctly defaults to "z", consistent with the omission of any special conditions for zero in the code.

These scenarios are designed to ensure comprehensive testing of the `Mervin1` function's logic, covering expected results for defined conditions, and verifying default behavior for undefined inputs. Each case checks a logical branch, promoting confidence that the function will behave correctly under different input scenarios.
